SDG Selection:
SDG : Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions
This is where we focus on ensuring access to justice and building effective institutions, which includes the sub-goal of identifying and reuniting lost or missing individuals.

Problem Definition:
One pressing issue is finding lost individuals, particularly children, refugees, or elderly people with memory impairments. This can be addressed by creating a centralized database that collects, organizes, and analyzes missing persons' reports and matches them with sightings or recovered individuals using data.
